# TheCodingBot
Welcome to TheCodingBot. The hobby Discord bot created by TheCodingGuy#6697.

## Version 5 is in HEAVY DEVELOPMENT
Do not expect anything to work as intended. As if, anything ever worked anyways. :P

## Get this version goin'!
- First, you'll need to ensure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
- Then, download this branch.
- Afterwards, fire up a terminal/command prompt and run `npm install` in the newly created directory, wait for packages to install. Kill some time by proceeding to the next step.
  - :information_source: **Wherever `package-lock.json` is, just run that command there.
- Modify the `src/cfg/tokendata.json.example`.
  - You'll also need to obtain a Discord token from [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).
  - If you wish to have support for osu! stats and stuff, you'll need to obtain a API key from [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/api/).
  - Save the file.
  - :warning: **You'll need to rename the file from `tokendata.json.example` to `tokendata.json`.**
- Modify the `src/cfg/system.json`.
  - Place your ID where the placeholder `yourUserIDHere` is.
  - :warning: **Do not worry about changing emotes at this time.**
  - :warning: **Do not worry about changing the `logURL` or `imgAPI` until a release regarding those items are publicly available.**
- Run `npm start` after changing everything that is stated above.
  - :information_source: **You can also use `npm start true` to enable debug logging, however this is a mess and really spammy.**
- Boom, you have a v5 clone. Kinda, I guess.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
I'm not gonna hold your hand the entire way through. If you are genuinely confused on something I wrote, I'll assist.
And no, I'm not gonna merge anything and everything into the branch. I'll most likely make small changes to fit the code (if needed) and then merge it.
 - :warning: **If the code is fully unable to merge, the idea is stolen, doesn't make sense, etc. I will *not* accept your request.**
And before you say anything, no I'm not strict, I'm just trying to set some order around here. kthx.
