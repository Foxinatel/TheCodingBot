# TheCodingBot
Welcome to TheCodingBot. The hobby Discord bot created by TheCodingGuy#6697.

## Version 5 is in HEAVY DEVELOPMENT
Do not expect anything to work as intended. As if, anything ever worked anyways. :P

## Get this version goin'!
- First, you'll need to ensure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
- Then, download this branch.
- Afterwards, fire up a terminal and run `npm install`.
- Now, go to into the `src` folder and run `npm install`, wait for packages to install. Kill some time by proceeding to the next step.
- Modify the `src/cfg/tokendata.json.example`.
  - You'll also need to obtain a Discord token from [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).
  - If you wish to have support for osu! stats and stuff, you'll need to obtain a API key from [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/api/).
  - Save the file.
  - :warning: **You'll need to rename the file from `tokendata.json.example` to `tokendata.json`.**
- Run `npm run start` after changing everything that is stated above.
- Boom, you have a v5 clone.
